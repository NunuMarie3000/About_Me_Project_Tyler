    My <small><small>small</small></small> biography
</h2>
<p><div class = "para">
My name is Tyler. I was born in Covington a while ago. I've lived in Memphis since I graduated high school all the way back in 2007.
 I bumped into things for a long time until I met my wife. We eventually had a boy child. Oh, and we're about to have boy child number 2.

    <h2>Education History</h2>
    
    <div class = "para">As for my education history, that is a tricky, winding, unfinished, ADHD riddled timeline. <br><ul>
    <li>I graduated high school in 2007</li>
    <li>I started a degree in international business and foreign language before I realized I hated everything about what I just typed.</li>
    <li>I dropped out two successful semesters later to work in management at UPS before realizing I would wake up 60 years old having completely wasted my life</li>
    <li>I came back to University of Memphis when I was 23 to finish a double major in Philosophy and sociology. I didn't finish either.</li>
    <li>Six years later I started taking classes in Computer Science for fun and here I am.</li>
    </ul></div>
